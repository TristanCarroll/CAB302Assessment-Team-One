Bye-Bye Box Eyes (Eye Guard) 
***
Project Brief  
Bye-Bye Box Eyes is an application for reducing eye strain and encouraging people to incorporate healthy habits into their computer use. The application is designed to promote eye health by preventing Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). Bye-Bye Box Eyes targets those who spend prolonged hours working on a screen and aims to assist them by encouraging healthy habits.

Project features and Summary  
***
User signing, logging, and creating profiles  
The application requires a user to input a username, email and password to register an account.
There is a password reset functionality that sends a temporary password to the users email account to log in with.
Then the user can update their password in the settings page. If the current logged-in user wishes to change their password, they will need their current password.

Timer functionality  
The application has robust features that enable a logged-in user to set, edit, delete, and favourite timers to the profiles. They can also stop a running timer
When the timer play button has been clicked the application minimises and runs in the background, allowing our user to focus on their work. 
When the timer is complete a notification sound alerts the user to take a break. The application will display a pop-up notification in the bottom corner of the screen.

Tips  
The tips provide preventative measures to combat CVS and give the user exercises to complete over their break. The see tips button click will display a random input of helpful messages to the application.

Statistics  
The statistics section showcases the userâ€™s total time with the option to view a customised time log. The custom time log can show the total time for the day, the number of sessions. Also provided is a weekly and monthly view that will display the aforementioned days the application has been used.
There will also be a graph to display the information of the users total time on the Statistics landing page

Goals  
Were not incorporated. The logic for the page is implemented, however, the MoSCoW priority for the goals section were all under 'Should' and 'Could' have.

Settings  
The settings page displays the current logged-in username. They have the option to reset their password by entering their current password and entering a new password. If valid old password is correct then the updated password will be valid. The user has the option to log out which will log the user out and close the current session.
The user also has the option to delete their profile which is an irreversible option. There will be no way of recovering their account.
